interactions with cosmic rays

cold runaway vs relativistic feedback

realistic thunderstorm electric fields

define a new feedback paramater as "number of positrons and photons that produce an electron with energy equal to or high then threshold energy diveded by seed electrons"
	compare new parameter to Dwyer's old parameter
	test how much feedback has to propagte to beginning of region by finding distribution of locations that positrons and photons produce new high-energy electrons

	find how the "strength" of the resulting avalanche depends on feedback position. need to find a good way to define 		strength. Consider current moment

Find how long it takes an avalanche to reach equlibrium. (Find average energy vs number of avalanche lengths, and fit to exponential curve)

model RF emissions from TGF (consider both models) and find if avanlanch component or "recoil pulse" is more significant.

look at TGF beam angles

look at detailed effect of RFD on thudnerstorm electric fields.  What will happen due to winds in thunderstorm?
