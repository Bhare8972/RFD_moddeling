methods and final shape of shielded coulomb scattering?
interpolation between distributions?
how to pick energies: number?  linear or logrithmic?

recombination of low-energy electrons?
if particles have different timesteps, then couldn't electrons that recombine with atmosphere affect particles at wrong time?

valid energy range for moller cross section?

Why should minimum energy for moller scattering be K_thresh (energy for runaway)??
The minimum energy in "The Physics of Lightning" is not K_thresh, it is 100 ev, and some electrons are produced at that energy
Why do I have on the order of 255 interactions per tau? Is this correct?
