1)  coulomb scattering assumes that energy is constant (without any error control), when rest of program assumes higher-order change of energy

2) FSAL in Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta isn't correct becouse scattering changes the momentum vector in between time steps.
	-have removed use of FSAL

3) the interaction_chooser assumes that the relative probability between different kinds of interactions is constant across a timestep
