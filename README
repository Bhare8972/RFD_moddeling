# RFD_modelling
Project to model RREA, RFD, and similar processes. Heavily based on Dr. Dwyer's work.

Requires GSL (gnu scientific library) to be installed,  and cmake


important sources:
	lehtinen et al. 1999 "Monte Carlo simulation of runaway MeV electron breakdown with application to red sprites and terrestrial gamma ray flashes"
	Dwyer 2007 "Relativistic breakdown in planetary atmospheres"


build location needs the following folders:
algorithm_tests
make_tables
tables


note that, as of writing this, the premade tables were made on a little-endian machine, but the reading/writing code does not check for correct endianness
