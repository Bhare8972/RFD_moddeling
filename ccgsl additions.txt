vector and vector_float:
	added +, +=, - and -= overloaded opperators for two vectors

	added *, *=, / and /= overloaded opperators for vectors on doublesï»¿

	TODO: define *, *=, / and /= for two vectors and +, +=, - and -= for vector and double!
	
	added vec_lessThan, vec_greaterThan, vec_equalTo to vector. Returns a vector_ushort for boolean
	
	added sum and sum_of_squares, uses kahan summation algorithm
	
vector_ushort
	added vec_and, vec_or    comparison vectors
	and all_true and any_true   to tell if any components are true or all components are true
	
	

utilities:
	
gsl::vector linspace(double stop, size_t length)
gsl::vector linspace(double start, double stop, size_t length)
	
	returns a vector of size 'length' of equally spaced points between start and stop. if start is not provided, it is assumed to be 0
	
gsl::vector logspace(double start_pow, double stop_pow, size_t length, double base=10.0)
	
	same as linspace, but with a logrithmic spacing
	
gsl::vector make_vector(size_t length, double value=0.0)
	returns a gsl vector of length that is filled with value, where value default is zero

gsl::vector cross(gsl::vector A, gsl::vector B)
	returns cross product of A and B. Throws exception if length of A and B are not both 3
