TODO:

turn main loop into a class

Test diffusion scattering against lehtinen method and molier scattering

test results of simulation against lehtenin.


improve moller scattering to use cumulative integral equation
create a special utility that works for inserting and retrieving data related to doubles. (span_tree) probably implented as variant of AVL tree 
		(better for lookups than inserts)

BREMSTRALHUNG!!!!!

Then test simulation against Dwyer and find slowdowns.





Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

test diffusion tables!

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
