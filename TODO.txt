TODO:

physics:

check beth friction formulas for accuracy.
Improve shielded coulomb scattering. Perhaps replace sin(theta) or sin(theta)^2 with a variable, and do inverse transform sampling
Do we need to test probability that shielded coulomb scattering?  If not, why not?
Test moller scattering for accuracy. Should we improve the accuracy?

note that we assume probability that a process happens is binomial. This only works for small P. In reality, it is poisson.  For each
process, how large is the probability? How significant is the error?


other:
reorganize code into differant files. hpp vs cpp? - make code modular to be able to easily build different simulations
write out notes into a latex file. VERY IMPORTANT
improve utility documentation.  less important.
