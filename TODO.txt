TODO:

move much of the code in "simulation.cpp" into thier own files in physics. make data saving as part of particle type

BREMSTRALHUNG!!!!!

Then test simulation against Dwyer and find slowdowns. 


Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

test diffusion tables!

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
