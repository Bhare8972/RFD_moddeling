TODO:

organize code


refactor binary and array IO
	make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines

add writing out by CSV

add atmosphere density vs altitude

finish adding bremsstrahlung
	document bremsstrahlung

Then test simulation against Dwyer and find slowdowns.


fixed constant and linear interaction samplers
add addaptive interaction sampler


re-do coulomb scattering to be indexed by number of interactions instead of time,to perhaps reduce energy dependance?





other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe (check other utilities for thread saftey)

work GSL code into project itself instead of being external dependancy
