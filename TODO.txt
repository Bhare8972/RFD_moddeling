TODO:


Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

test diffusion tables!

seperate absolute minimum physical energy ( 100 ev), which needs to be hard-coded
and minimum energy for simulation, which should be a simulation input. NOT hard-coded
remove function_apply, and loop over every particle
turn many of the cross-section functions into classes

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
