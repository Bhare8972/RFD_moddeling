TODO:

turn main loop into a class

notice that the "Z" of air is molecular Z!! find errors that this has caused (namely in diffision scattering) and fix it!

test results of simulation against lehtenin.

add atmosphere density vs altitude

BREMSTRALHUNG!!!!!

Then test simulation against Dwyer and find slowdowns.

improve spline to use GSl spline functions where applicable.

add new walker aliasing!!





Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

test diffusion tables!

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
