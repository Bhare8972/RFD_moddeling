TODO:

turn main loop into a class

Test diffusion scattering against lehtinen method and mollier scattering ????

test results of simulation against lehtenin.

create a special utility that works for inserting and retrieving data related to doubles. (span_tree) probably implented as variant of AVL tree 
		(better for lookups than inserts)

add atmosphere density

BREMSTRALHUNG!!!!!

Then test simulation against Dwyer and find slowdowns.

improve spline to use GSl spline functions where applicable





Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

test diffusion tables!

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
