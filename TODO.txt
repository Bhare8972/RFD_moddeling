TODO:

need to test integation and spline fitting to make sure it makes sence

implement adaptive runge-kutta for the equations of motion.
Fix production of the diffusion table, so that the convergence condition has a better statisitcal basis. (Maybe use pearson chi-square test)
	Also need to add adaptive bin sizes.

other:
improve utility documentation.  less important.
figure out why interpolant is not thread safe
try to remove a few mutexes from make_diffusion_table
make reading/writing binary files to correctly handel big-endian machines
